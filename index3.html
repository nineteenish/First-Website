                <p>As a Web Developer, it is key to keep yourself as marketable and useful as possible. 
                Like any other technology-based field, Web Development is a constantly changing landscape 
                with a growing spectrum of technologies to master. The best thing you can do is choose an

                your value to employers. This article, while it may be a bit dated, can be helpful to
